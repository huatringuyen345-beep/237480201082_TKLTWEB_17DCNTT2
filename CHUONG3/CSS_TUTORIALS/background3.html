<h1>The background-attachment Property</h1>

<p>The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page).</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you do not see any scrollbars, try to resize the browser window.</p>

<!--CSS background - Shorthand property-->
<h1>The background Property</h1>

<p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.</p>

<p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

<p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>
